                    <p style="color: pink;">
                        A guitar is a string instrument with a body, neck, and six strings, though variations exist with seven or twelve strings.
                        The body amplifies sound produced by the strings, made of nylon or steel, while the neck holds frets dividing it into segments for different pitches. 
                        The headstock contains tuning pegs for adjusting string tension. Guitars come in various types like acoustic, electric, classical, and bass, each offering a unique sound. 
                        Learning guitar involves mastering techniques like fretting, strumming, picking, and chord formation, allowing players to express themselves through its diverse sounds.
